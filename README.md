This project creates an AI pipeline for processing images with the following goals: segmentation, object identification, and data extraction. 
Here's an example of a complete README file for an image segmentation and object analysis project on GitHub:

*Image Segmentation and Object Analysis Project*

*Overview*

This project focuses on developing a computer vision system for image segmentation and object analysis. The goal is to accurately identify, classify, and analyze objects within images, enabling applications such as object detection, tracking, and recognition.

*Key Features*

- Image Segmentation: Divide images into regions of interest (ROI) based on pixel characteristics
- Object Detection: Identify and locate specific objects within the segmented regions
- Object Classification: Classify detected objects into predefined categories
- Object Analysis: Extract features and attributes from detected objects for further analysis

*Methodologies*

- Deep Learning-based approaches (e.g., CNN, U-Net) for image segmentation and object detection
- Traditional computer vision techniques (e.g., thresholding, edge detection) for object analysis
- Evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) for performance assessment


*Repository Structure*

- `data/`: Dataset and annotations
- `models/`: Trained models and configuration files
- Source code for image segmentation, object detection, and analysis
- `results/`: Output files and visualizations

*Getting Started*

Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

*Usage*

Main script for running image segmentation and object analysis
Script for image segmentation using deep learning modelsScript for object detection using traditional computer vision techniques 
Script for object analysis and feature extraction

Evaluation 
Script for evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall
